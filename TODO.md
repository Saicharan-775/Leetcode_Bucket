# TODO: Fix Dashboard Component CSS Styling

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Edit src/pages/Dashboard.jsx to redesign the "Your Buckets" grid layout for proper 3-column structure on lg+ screens, remove negative margins on ProgressCard, improve responsiveness and spacing.
- [x] Edit src/ui/StatCards.jsx to make width responsive (w-full max-w-72 instead of fixed w-72).
- [x] Edit src/ui/buckets.jsx to adjust width for better grid flexibility (remove or condition sm:w-[500px]).
- [ ] Run the app to verify the layout changes.
- [ ] Test the dashboard on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and no visual glitches.
